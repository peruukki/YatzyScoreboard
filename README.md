I was running out of Yatzy scoreboard cards again, and making new ones is always a daunting task (I can never get the
lines straight!). So I decided to make a digital one, as it can also count the score totals for you, which is another
time-consuming and error-prone task. It was also a good opportunity to try out
[Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).
